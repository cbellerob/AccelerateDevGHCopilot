**Develop new code features using GitHub Copilot**

### GitHub Copilot Exercise

This repository contains lab materials for the **mslearn-github-copilot-dev**, 'Develop new code features using GitHub Copilot' module. This exercise provides hands-on experience with the capabilities of **GitHub Copilot**.

### Exercise Overview

This exercise involves adding new functionality to a temporary library management application created to support local library operations. The specific goal is to build a feature that reports whether a book is currently available or, if not, when it is expected to be returned.

As part of the workflow, the application is set up in Visual Studio Code, placed under version control with a new GitHub repository, and updated through a dedicated feature branch. GitHub Copilot is used throughout the development process to speed up coding and improve accuracy. After development, the updates are pushed to the remote branch and merged into the main project.

The exercise is completed in **two language implementations**:  
- **C#**  
- **Python**
